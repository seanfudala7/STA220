# Activity 3.3a: Make the case for one bike lane.
#
# Pine County can afford ONE protected bike lane. Your group argues for ONE street:
#   Group 1: Market Street    Group 2: Ridge Road    Group 3: College Avenue    Group 4: Station Road
#
# To Do: copy everything under The Figure (and any steps above it that make a table or do a merge) from your example. Paste it under Your Figure.

#  The Key (Use this to compare Highway to Bikes! -------------------------



#   In the examples                        In your data
#   highway_sections (one line each)       bike_corridors
#   highway_yearly (2016 to 2025)          bike_yearly (2023 to 2025), or bike_monthly for months
#   highway_hourly                         bike_hourly
#   highway_crashes (one point each)       bike_crashes
#   section, my_section, section_colours   corridor, my_corridor, corridor_colours
#   vehicles_per_day                       bikes_per_day (riders) or cars_per_day
#   vehicles_per_hour                      bikes_per_hour
#   avg_speed_mph, speed_limit             car_speed_mph, speed_limit
#   rush_delay_min, truck_pct              (nothing like them; try bikes_per_day or cars_per_day)
#   crashes, serious_crashes               crashes, serious_crashes
#   severity                               severity (the same three levels)
#   crash_type                             crash_type: dooring, turning car, passing car, other
#   town, x, y (on each crash)             town, x, y
#   cost_million, years_to_build           cost_million, years_to_build
#   homes_affected, wetland_acres          parking_lost, trees_removed
#   miles                                  miles
#   (not in the highway data)              connects_to, counted_since
#
#   Examples 5 and 11: names_prefix = "vehicles_" makes vehicles_2016 to vehicles_2025. Yours can be
#   names_prefix = "bikes_", which makes bikes_2023 to bikes_2025. Station Road has no 2023 count,
#   so its 2023 to 2025 change is NA: use 2024 to 2025, or say on the figure why it is missing.
#
#   Examples 5, 10, and 12 draw my_section again on top (the table called mine) in its own colour.
#   Use filter(corridor == my_corridor), and your street's colour from corridor_colours above.
#
#   A rate for bikes: crashes per 100,000 bike trips = crashes / (bikes_per_day x 365) x 100000
#   (drop the years with no count first: filter(!is.na(bikes_per_day)))
#
#   Remember to change the title, the axis labels, and the caption to fit your figure and your argument.


# Hints -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hints
#   1. Check that you loaded the data by running the script above!
#   2. Highlight a word and other matching will e highlighted. 
#   3. Run your code one step at a time (or one pipe at a time)
#   5. A few examples need some hints:
#        Example 3    the streets are short, so try binwidth = 0.25
#        Example 7    use the bike rate in The Key (crashes per 100,000 bike trips)
#        Example 8    there is no bike speed: use car_speed_mph (keep geom_hline()), or
#                     bikes_per_hour (and delete the geom_hline() line)
#        Example 9    for Market Street, try fill = crash_type in place of severity
#        Example 12   there is no rush-hour delay for bikes: divide something else by
#                     cost_million (riders per $1 million, or crashes per $1 million)
#        Example 13   the hardest one: count(town) works on bike_crashes too, and Cedar and Fir
#                     (none of the four streets) come out grey
